# Homebrew Cask Release Notes

CC FLOW is published through the official Homebrew Cask repository. Users can
install it directly without adding a custom tap:

```bash
brew install --cask trae-flow
```

Machines that still have the legacy `erha19/tap` tap may resolve that tap before
the official cask. Remove the old tap once before checking the official source:

```bash
brew untap erha19/tap
brew install --cask trae-flow
```

The cask installs from the same notarized DMG that the GitHub Release and
Sparkle release flow publish.

## CI Release Flow

The release workflow is intentionally limited to assets owned by this
repository:

1. Build and notarize the macOS app.
2. Publish the signed DMG and ZIP to the matching GitHub Release.
3. Publish Sparkle appcast assets when Sparkle signing secrets are configured.
4. Publish the Linux `CCFlowBridge` assets.

The workflow no longer pushes to an external `homebrew-tap` repository. That
keeps release CI focused on first-party build artifacts and avoids a second
GitHub token with write access to a tap.

## Release Verification

After a stable GitHub Release is published, verify that Homebrew can see the
official cask:

```bash
brew update
brew info --cask trae-flow
```

If `brew info` reports `From: https://github.com/ccsonicc333/homebrew-tap.git`, the
local machine is still resolving the legacy tap. Run `brew untap erha19/tap` and
check again.

For a full install check on a clean macOS machine:

```bash
brew install --cask trae-flow
```

If Homebrew has not picked up the latest version yet, update the official cask
through Homebrew's normal cask contribution flow instead of changing this
repository's release CI.
